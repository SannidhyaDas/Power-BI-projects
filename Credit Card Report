ðŸš€ Empowering Data-Driven Decisions with Advanced Credit Card Transaction Analytics ðŸ’³

As businesses increasingly prioritize data-driven insights, having a solid foundation in data visualization and analysis is critical. I am thrilled to share a recent project where we leveraged Power BI to create an actionable Credit Card Transaction Dashboard.

Key highlights:

Analyzed 57M+ in revenue, breaking it down by card type, consumer job, education, expenditure, and more.
Visualized week-on-week transaction trends, identifying crucial customer behavior patterns.
Segmented data by income group, marital status, and age, providing granular insights into consumer spending habits.
Tracked key metrics such as total transaction count, interest earned, and week-over-week growth.
With a deep dive into consumer profiles, including job roles, education levels, and expenditure categories, this dashboard allows for informed decision-making, leading to targeted marketing strategies and improved customer satisfaction.
