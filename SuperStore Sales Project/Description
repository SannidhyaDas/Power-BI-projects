Interactive Power BI Dashboard: Sales Analysis & Forecasting for a Retail Superstore
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and forecast sales performance for a retail superstore. The dashboard provides multi-dimensional insights into payment modes, shipping methods, regional trends, product categories, and time-based patterns. By equipping business users with actionable intelligence, the project helps optimize operations and enhance profitability.

The objective was to visualize key metrics and provide forecasting capabilities to support data-driven decision-making. This dashboard serves as a strategic tool for business managers, offering insights that enable them to streamline operations, enhance the customer experience, and plan proactively for future demand.

1. Sales Performance Overview
The Sales Overview section offers a high-level snapshot of performance metrics:

Total Sales: $1.57 million
Profit: $175.26K
Quantity Sold: 22,000 units
Average Delivery Days: 4 days
These key indicators provide a quick summary of the business’s revenue, profitability, and product movement, helping managers monitor performance at a glance and detect potential issues.

2. Regional and State-wise Performance
The dashboard reveals regional sales patterns, highlighting performance differences across geographic regions and states.

Sales by Region:
West (33%) and East (29%) regions are top performers.
Central (22%) and South (16%) regions contribute smaller shares but present growth opportunities.
Top States by Sales:
California leads with $0.34M, followed by New York ($0.19M) and Texas ($0.12M).
Other key contributors include Washington, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.
These insights enable region-focused strategies, such as allocating resources to high-performing states or running campaigns to boost sales in lower-performing regions.

3. Customer Segmentation & Payment Preferences
Customer segmentation provides deeper insights into purchase behavior and helps tailor offerings.

Sales by Customer Segment:
Consumers account for 48% of total sales.
Corporate clients contribute 33%, reflecting demand from businesses.
Home Office users represent 19%, indicating relevance for remote work setups.
Payment Preferences:
Cash on Delivery (COD): 43% of transactions
Online payments: 35%
Card payments: 22%
This breakdown reflects diverse payment preferences. COD’s prominence suggests a need to maintain efficient payment collection processes, while growing online payments highlight opportunities for digital promotions.

4. Shipping Mode Insights
Analyzing shipping modes reveals insights into delivery preferences and logistics efficiency.

Standard Class contributes the highest sales ($0.33M), indicating a preference for affordable delivery.
Second Class accounts for $0.11M, followed by First Class and Same Day Delivery with smaller but focused usage.
The business can use these insights to optimize logistics—offering more capacity for Standard Class while using premium delivery selectively for time-sensitive orders.

5. Product Category and Sub-category Analysis
Product-level analysis ensures the business stays aligned with customer preferences.

Top Categories:
Office Supplies: $0.64M
Technology: $0.47M
Furniture: $0.45M
Top Sub-categories:

These insights support inventory optimization by ensuring top-selling products are well-stocked and promoting high-demand items in targeted campaigns.

6. Time-based Trends and Forecasting
The time-series analysis highlights seasonal trends and provides forecasting insights for future planning.

Monthly Sales Trends (2019-2020):
Sales steadily rise in Q3 and Q4, with December as the peak month due to holiday demand.
Similar trends in consecutive years confirm seasonality, helping the business align its marketing efforts with high-demand periods.
Profit by Month:

Monthly profit trends help identify cost-saving opportunities and align budgets with peak periods.
30-day Forecast:
